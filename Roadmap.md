- [ ] Namespaces, autoloading (PSR-4)  
- [ ] OOP: class, object, constructor, visibility, inheritance, overriding  
- [ ] Abstract classes, interfaces, traits  
- [ ] Static members, late static binding, magic methods (`__get`, `__set`, `__call`, `__toString`, etc.)  
- [ ] Encapsulation, polymorphism, composition vs inheritance  
- [ ] Exception handling (`try/catch/finally`, custom exceptions)  
- [ ] Anonymous classes, attributes, enums (PHP 8.1+)  
- [ ] SPL interfaces and iterators  
- [ ] Generators (`yield`)  
- [ ] Filesystem (`fopen`, `file_get_contents`, `file_put_contents`, streams)  
- [ ] DateTime and time zones  
- [ ] Regular expressions (`preg_*`)  
- [ ] JSON handling, serialization  
- [ ] Sessions, cookies, headers  
- [ ] PHP configuration basics (`php.ini`, `error_reporting`)  
- [ ] Composer usage, semantic versioning  
- [ ] PSR standards (PSR-1, PSR-4, PSR-12, PSR-7, PSR-15, PSR-17)  
- [ ] Memory and performance profiling (Xdebug basics)

## 🧩 2. Algorithms and Data Structures

- [ ] Arrays (indexed, associative, multidimensional)  
- [ ] String algorithms (reverse, search, replace, parse)  
- [ ] Sorting (custom comparator, `usort`)  
- [ ] Searching and filtering arrays  
- [ ] Stack, queue, linked list implementation in PHP  
- [ ] Hash maps (array usage)  
- [ ] Recursion  
- [ ] Time-space complexity estimation

## 🗄️ 3. SQL / Database

- [ ] DDL, DML, DCL basics  
- [ ] Joins: inner, left, right, full  
- [ ] Aggregate functions, GROUP BY, HAVING  
- [ ] Subqueries, derived tables  
- [ ] CTEs, window functions (`ROW_NUMBER`, `RANK`, `SUM OVER`)  
- [ ] Constraints, foreign keys, cascading  
- [ ] Transactions, ACID properties, isolation levels  
- [ ] Indexes, composite indexes, query plans (`EXPLAIN`)  
- [ ] Normalization (1NF–3NF) and denormalization trade-offs  
- [ ] Views, stored procedures, triggers (read only)  
- [ ] Query optimization basics  
- [ ] Practical SQL task solving

## 🌐 4. HTTP / REST

- [ ] HTTP methods and semantics  
- [ ] Status codes and their meaning  
- [ ] Headers, cookies, caching directives  
- [ ] JSON request/response structure  
- [ ] REST design principles, idempotency, pagination, filtering  
- [ ] Authentication (token-based, session-based)  
- [ ] CORS, CSRF, XSS, SQL Injection prevention

## ⚙️ 5. Laravel Framework

- [ ] Installation, configuration, environment files  
- [ ] Request lifecycle and Service Container  
- [ ] Service Providers, Facades, Contracts  
- [ ] Routing, route model binding, middleware  
- [ ] Controllers, dependency injection  
- [ ] Validation, FormRequest, custom rules  
- [ ] Eloquent ORM: CRUD, scopes, accessors, mutators, relationships  
- [ ] Query Builder and raw queries  
- [ ] Eager vs lazy loading, performance tuning  
- [ ] Database migrations, seeders, factories  
- [ ] Authentication: Breeze, Sanctum, Passport  
- [ ] Authorization: Gates, Policies  
- [ ] Events, Listeners, Observers  
- [ ] Jobs, Queues, Workers  
- [ ] Notifications (mail, database, Firebase)  
- [ ] Caching (Cache facade, tags, Redis)  
- [ ] File Storage (local, S3)  
- [ ] Logging, custom channels, exception handling  
- [ ] API Resources, transformers  
- [ ] Testing: Feature, Unit, HTTP tests, database testing  
- [ ] Task scheduling (Kernel, cron)  
- [ ] Localization, configuration management  
- [ ] Dependency inversion and repository-service architecture  
- [ ] Laravel performance optimization (query count, cache usage, config caching)  
- [ ] Laravel deployment (artisan commands, env, migrations, queues)

## 🏗️ 6. Architecture and Design

- [ ] MVC separation of concerns  
- [ ] SOLID principles  
- [ ] Repository pattern, Service layer  
- [ ] Dependency Injection  
- [ ] DRY, KISS, YAGNI principles  
- [ ] Clean code formatting and naming
